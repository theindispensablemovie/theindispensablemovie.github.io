                        <p class="cogitation">
                            I grew up in an environment where the odds were always against us... I remember during my high school there was a shortage of teachers in our school especially in the Math and Science stream which I opted for. This meant that we had to find ways of understanding those subjects without a teacher, now this really needed tenacity and sagacity. Ohh how tenacity was instilled into the young boy's life, the circumstances demanded it otherwise you will suffocate. Indeed it is true that nobody is really weak there are just strengths you haven't discovered yet, that was a discovery point for me. I got to know that you can sit down and learn to a point of understanding without the aid of a third party. When we thought it couldn't get any worse than it was, there's a teacher strike that broke out during our matriculation year which meant no school for months. When the dust settled we were few weeks from exams, it was indeed one of the interesting matric exams in history.

                        <p class="cogitation">
                            Against all odds we emerged Victorious. Out of 100+ matriculants from that school, It was only 5 who got University entrance pass, out of that 5 I was the only one who passed with distinctions. The next huddle was who's gonna pay for my fees which led to an unplanned gap year(what a year it was, only God knows what would have transpired, yet in the mind of the divine something amazing was brooding)
                         Earlier that year a call came in for a bursary, that call settled a desire a young man carried from childhood, indeed hope maketh not ashamed. It will take me a while to explain what happened in that interview, there was one particular question that was asked which left the panel in tears, the rest is history. Analyzing the sequence of events one can say "IT IS THE STORY OF GOD'S GRACE", It is not of him that willeth nor runneth but of God that shows mercy. We did it even though we had our backs up against the wall. We learned to swim against the tide, I've seen a Lilly push its way through a stubborn soil. In the process the impossible became to us the very thing that made us tick, the very fuel for our projection, AGAINST ALL ODDS!!!

                        <p class="cogitation">
                            As I reflect I realize that indeed the making of man is from above. No man can receive(Lambano) anything except it be given(granted, supplied, delivered) him from above. The sayings of God are His givings, He said so that we may be bold about what He gave us. The sayings are wrapped up like we wrap the the gifts to give to whom we will (of which in most cases we want to express our appreciation to them or just shower them with love or feel obliged to, in any case it is the giver's choice), this are thoughts wrapped up in vocabulary, WORDS they are. I heard inaudible messages in my inner most and I knew this are trustworthy but needed reference for bearing. Like dawn a day came and it was so clear were they proceeded from, Ohhh!!! what a day it was to meet The One I heard without sound , now that sounds perplexing yet it's simple that you will not need an explanation. That was a game-changer, for a better expression it was a life-changer moment, better still it was a life-giving moment because that which would have been thought of being changed was inexistent. Ever since that quickening the pulsations spurred everything it came in contact with, with so much vigour. The intensity of it is on an unending surge.

                        <p class="cogitation">
                            THere are finest hours in a man's life, ironically they're most disguised as hours of great difficulty or adversity. Moment of truimph of the spirit a defining moment for a man (where it is required for a man to express his ultimate nature), they defy logic; a time were a Spirit will have to perform uninterrupted. THink about Isreal facing the Red Sea, no logic could help them. God had to tell Moses not to interupt the process "Do not pray now Moses", it's a type of a showdown. The same was repeated during David and Goliath combat. Columbus said "You can never cross the ocean until you have the courage to lose sight of the shore", Stop coasting and throw yourself in !!! Ther's nothing to fear, this is your finest hour, this is your momemnt!!!

                        <p class="cogitation">
                            Trouble is ever appearing to sting yet there's no sting in it!!! It is ever longing for manifestation yet has no ability to. Trouble is one of the greatest deception. Do not let your heart be troubled, it is the emptiness of nothingness.
